## Reflection

**What is an HTTP request/response?**  
An HTTP request is how a browser asks for a web page. The response includes the page and a status code.

**What status code did you see, and what does it mean?**  
I saw 200 OK — meaning the page loaded successfully.

**One thing I learned about Git today:**  
I learned how to create a feature branch and pull request before merging to main.
